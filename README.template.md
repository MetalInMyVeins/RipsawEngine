# Note

There is absolutely zero tolerance for any AI generated code in engine code. If you want to contribute in the engine, write everything by yourself. The `sandbox/` directory is for testing the engine which essentially can mean it's game code. You can test in any way you want but AI generated code in `sandbox/` would not be pushed in the main branch. On the other hand, scripts in `scripts/` are unrelated to the engine codebase so as long as the functionality works properly, anything is acceptable. For example, `scripts/gen_docs.py` is completely AI generated whose functionality is to parse documentation from engine codebase and automatically generate [README.md](README.md).
